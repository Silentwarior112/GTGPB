GTGPB By Silentwarior112: A Gran Turismo .gpb extractor and maker

Features:
1. Extract the .gpb asset packages that contain various UI / menu textures, and output a functional configuration file to generate them back into a .gpb.
	GTGPB will dump the contents of the gpb, but will not perform any additional file format conversion, so you will still need
	to handle the modification of the dumped file(s) with other tools.

	Typical formats seen in a .gpb: Tex1 as .img (PS2-era GT games), TXS3 as .img (PS3-era GT games), etc.

2. Generate a .gpb with loose .img files using a configuration file.
	The configuration file will contain the path to your file(s), and their label that gets injected into the .gpb's header data.
	The texture labels are REQUIRED to be exactly what the game's scripting logic is looking for, and the textures themselves
	must be in the correct order as well. If not, the game will not display it, so make sure the configuration file is set correctly.

3. Update the file locations in an existing .gpb.
	If you happen to move your asset folder to another location
	on your computer, the configuration file will no longer
	work, as it specifies the exact file location on your computer.
	If this happens, you can use this function to update the file
	locations in the configuration file.
	
	Make sure that the textures inside your asset folder
	all match an existing texture label entry in the configuration
	file first.

How to use:
1. If you do not have python installed on your computer, you will need to install it first (~26mb download).
	https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Simply double-click the GTGPB.py file, and the GUI and console will load.

Extracting a .gpb:
	Click the extract button, locate your .gpb, then specify the output folder
	where the extracted textures will go.

	The original file/folder structure defined in the texture labels is replicated,
	and a configuration file to generate the textures back into a .gpb is generated
	in the same root folder you selected.

	All versions of gpb files are supported through this one button.


Modifying the asset folder:
	Replace the original .img file(s) with your own, 
	and make sure that its corresponding label in the config file is set correctly.

	For most situations, adhoc scripting is not modified, so you should only
	extract the .gpb, overwrite the dumped files with your own, and generate the .gpb.

	If you are modifying adhoc script and decide to change what labels it looks for,
	be mindful not to give texture labels any illegal characters if you want the script
	to still be able to extract and pack these correctly.

	To avoid any issues, stick to uppercase and lowercase letters,
	the forward slash ( / ),
	period ( . ),
	underscore ( _ ),
	and nothing else, and always label your textures as a file.
	For example, the simplest a label should be is "folder/file.extension"

	This will prevent any possible errors with the
	string and path handling in the tool's code.

Updating a configuration file:
	Click the `Update file locations in .ini` button, select your asset folder location, 
	and the tool will look for all files that match a texture
	label entry in the config file, and update the file path(s) to the
	new location(s) on your computer.

Generating a .gpb:
	Click the generate button corresponding to your desired target gpb version.
	When a gpb is extracted, the configuration file is named based on what gpb version was extracted
	so this will tell you which version you need to generate. However, there is no restriction
	on which version you can generate, if for whatever reason you want to build a gpb0 from an asset package dumped
	from a gpb3, you can do so.
	
	Specify your configuration file,
	then specify the .gpb output file.

	It will pack the textures specified within the configuration file.


Supported gpb formats:
gpb0: GT4 Prologue NTSC-J (PBPX-95523)
gpb1: GT4 Prologue PAL (SCES-52438), GT4 First Preview (NTSC-J) (PCPX-96649)
gpb2 (PS2): All retail releases of GT4, GT4 MX-5 Demo, Tourist Trophy
gpb2 (PS3): GT HD, GT5 prologue
gpb3: GTPSP, GT5, GT6

gpb2 for PS3 is 99.9% identical to gpb2 for PS2, the only difference is the padding is written
to the next factor of 128 instead of 16. However, I have tested factor of 16 padding on GT HD's
race_display\ps3\US\display.gpb and it works fine, so gpb2 generation with this tool 
is the same for both the PS2 and PS3 version.

gpb3's padding structure is not 100% replicated when generating a gpb3 with this tool.
It is similar but slightly different than original files.
Testing is needed to verify that the padding structure generated
with this tool is OK.

As I mentioned above, the padding structure of gpb3 files
is not 100% replicated / figured.
The padding structure mentioned here is what is currently
implemented into the gpb3 generation of this tool.

(This is Big-endian instead of little-endian)
